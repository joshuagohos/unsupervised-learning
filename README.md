# Extensions of the von der Malsburg self-organized visual cortex model
Unpublished work by Joshua Oon Soo Goh [\[1\]](#1) in fulfillment of Psych 591 Neural Network Modeling course conducted in Spring 2007 at the Dept. of Psychology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA, instructed by John Hummel. This work extends the use of a von der Malsburg model that updates its stimuli to excitatory layer weights using Hebbian Learning with spatially bound excitatory and inhibitory inputs as implemented in Von Der Malsburg, 1973 [\[2\]](#2). The manuscript extends the original model by evaluating its performance with respect to higher order visual line orientations (e.g. shapes). The primary code is writtern in R ([vdm_josh.R](~/code/vdm_josh.R)). Overall, the simulation exemplifies how an artificial neural network with biologically fixed excitatory and inhibitory connections can effect self-organization in the unit responses that it experiences in the external visual environment.
